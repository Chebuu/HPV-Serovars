@article{Einstein_2002,
	Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of our study was to characterize a human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA integration in the genome of a rapidly progressive, lethal cervical cancer in a 39-year-old woman. Experimental Design: An HPV 16 integration site from cervical cancer tissue was cloned and analyzed using Southern blot hybridization, nucleotide sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for chromosomal localization and comparison with the draft human genome sequence. Results: HPV 16 DNA (3826 bp) was integrated into the genome of the tumor sample and contained an intact upstream regulatory region and E6 and E7 open reading frames. Both 5′ and 3′ viral-cell junction regions contained direct repeat and palindrome sequences. The chromosomal location of the viral integration and cellular deletion was mapped to chromosome 14q32.3 using both a somatic cell hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Search of the draft human genome sequence confirmed the chromosomal location and revealed a disruption of the TNFAIP2 cytokine/retinoic acid-inducible gene. Conclusions: On the basis of the lack of sequence homology between the viral and cellular site of integration and the structure of the viral-cell junctions, it seems that HPV 16 DNA integrates into the host genome by a mechanism of nonhomologous recombination. We suggest that, taken together, maintenance of E6 and E7 expression, loss of the E2 gene and disruption of the TNFAIP2 gene through viral integration contributed to the rapid progression of cervical cancer in this patient. Availability of the human genome sequence will facilitate identification of cellular genes involved in cervical cancer by high-throughput analysis of viral integration sites.},

The ddCt package implements a pipeline to collect, analyse and visualize qRT-PCR results, for example those from TaqMan SDM software, mainly using the ddCt method. The pipeline can be either invoked by a script in command-line or through the API consisting of S4-Classes, methods and functions.},

	Abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that are extremely common worldwide. There are more than 100 types of HPV, of which at least 14 are cancer-causing (also known as high risk type). HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and most people are infected with HPV shortly after the onset of sexual activity. Cervical cancer is caused by sexually acquired infection with certain types of HPV. Two HPV types (16 and 18) cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancerous cervical lesions. There is also evidence linking HPV with cancers of the anus, vulva, vagina, penis and oropharynx. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions with an estimated 570 000 new cases (1) in 2018 (84% of the new cases worldwide). In 2018, approximately 311 000 women died from cervical cancer; more than 85% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Comprehensive cervical cancer control includes primary prevention (vaccination against HPV), secondary prevention (screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions), tertiary prevention (diagnosis and treatment of invasive cervical cancer) and palliative care. Vaccines that protect against HPV 16 and 18 are recommended by WHO and have been approved for use in many countries. Screening and treatment of pre-cancer lesions in women of 30 years and more is a cost-effective way to prevent cervical cancer. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance have shown that HPV vaccines are very safe and very effective in preventing infections with HPV infections. Cervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed at an early stage.},

@article{HPV_Genomics_Project,
	Annote = {This project is designed to interrogate the relationship between sequence changes in the HPV genome and carcinogenicity. There is huge variability in risk of precancer and cancer conferred by different HPV types that is poorly explained. HPV type 16 is known to cause half of all cervical cancer cases worldwide, however the specific reason for its carcinogenicity has been elusive. The simple question is ``Why is HPV16 so uniquely carcinogenic?'' High-throughput, next-generation sequencing methods are being used to study HPV 16 variant sub-lineages among women with cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN 3) in comparison to women with benign HPV infections. An Ampliseq/Ion Torrent-based assay for high-throughput whole-genome sequencing of HPV 16 was developed in 2015 (Cullen et al, 2015). The team has demonstrated the reliability, reproducibility, accuracy, and usefulness of this assay for HPV16 and expanded it to the other 13 carcinogenic types. A global, high-risk HPV genome sequencing method has been developed, and is being used to compare HPV16-related types to HPV16. Using the HPV16 assay, investigators sequenced the entire HPV16 genome in samples from over 3,200 infected women and classified the viruses into lineages and sublineages. Through this process they discovered considerable risk differences for precancer and cancer and identified specific variant sublineages that strongly influence HPV 16 carcinogenicity and histologic outcome (Mirabello et al, 2016). Further, investigators compared HPV16 genomic sequences between cases and controls and discovered that controls, who had benign infections, had infections with significantly more protein-changing variants throughout the genome, while cases had infections devoid of protein-changing variants particularly in the E7 oncogene (Mirabello et al, 2017). These findings contribute to resolving the outstanding question of why common and typically benign HPV16 infections only sometimes cause cancer. Follow-up work on the potent carcinogenicity of an intact HPV16 E7 protein is underway. Additional case-control and prospective approaches are being used to determine how HPV genetic variation informs our understanding of carcinogenesis and influences risk for cancer. Studies are underway to evaluate all the HR-HPV types at the cervix and non-cervical sites, and evaluations of the interplay of host-viral genetics. DCEG experts have also developed a novel Next-Generation Sequencing HPV genotyping assay based on their HPV genome sequencing. The new approach provides low-cost, high-throughput genotyping that will lead to major cost-savings for large cervical cancer screening and vaccination studies conducted by DCEG and other research groups since most current genotyping assays are expensive and laborious.

	Abstract = {Although HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients have improved prognosis compared to HPV negative patients; there remains an HPV-positive group who have poor outcomes. Biomarkers to stratify discrete patient outcomes are thus desirable. Our objective was to analyse viral load (VL) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), in HPV-positive patients with OPC on whom clinical outcome data were available.In a cohort of patients that had previously tested HPV positive via conventional PCR, VL was determined using ddPCR assays for HPV16 L1 and E6 genes. VL was classed as ``medium/high'' if more than 5.57 copies or 8.68 copies of the HPV 16 L1 or E6 gene were detected respectively. Effect of VL on overall survival and hazard of death & disease progression was performed with adjustments made for sex, age, deprivation, smoking, alcohol consumption and stage.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSEHuman papilloma virus (HPV) infection is associated with several anogenital malignancies. Here, we set out to evaluate digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) as a tool for HPV 16, 18, 33 and 45 viral load quantification and, in addition, to compare the efficacy of the ddPCR assay for HPV 16 detection with that of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).METHODSClinical samples, positive for HPV genotypes 16, 18, 33 and 45 were analyzed for viral load using ddPCR. Sample DNA was cleaved before droplet generation and PCR. Droplets positive for VIC and FAM fluorescence were read in a QX200 Droplet reader{\texttrademark} (BIO-RAD) after which the viral load was calculated using Quantasoft software.RESULTSWe found that DNAs extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples yielded lower amplification signals compared to those obtained from liquid based cytology (LBC) samples, but they were clearly distinguishable from negative background signals. The viral limit of detection was 1.6 copies of HPV 16, 2.8 copies of HPV 18, 4.6 copies of HPV 33 and 1.6 copies of HPV 45. The mean inter-assay coefficients of variability (CV) for the assays ranged from 3.4 to 7.0%, and the mean intra-assay CV from 2.6 to 8.2%. The viral load in the different cohorts of tumor samples ranged from 154 to 340,200 copies for HPV 16, 244 to 31,300 copies for HPV 18 and 738 to 69,100 copies for HPV 33. One sample positive for HPV 45 contained 1331 viral copies. When comparing qPCR data with ddPCR copy number data, the qPCR values were found to be 1 to 31 times higher.CONCLUSIONSSeparation of fragments in nanodroplets may facilitate the amplification of fragmented human and viral DNA. The method of digital droplet PCR may, thus, provide a new and promising tool for evaluating the HPV viral load in clinical samples.},

	Abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, leads to more than 5% of cancers in the world [1]. More than a dozen HPV subtypes are regarded as high-risk due to their direct role in the transformation of cells and an increased probability of cervical and oropharyngeal cancers. Among these subtypes, the HPV16 and HPV18 are the most prevalent, detected in approximately 70% of cervical cancers and in 90% of oropharyngeal cancers [1]. HPV16 and 18 immortalize and transform cells by integrating stretches of their viral sequences (including the oncogenic E6 and E7 regions) into the cellular genome. Early HPV detection using sensitive and specific molecular techniques capable of distinguishing high-risk HPV types from low-risk HPV types is essential to the treatment of precancerous lesions and the prevention of cervical cancer progression. Here, we show how a 3-color Crystal Digital PCRTM assay (Table 1) on the NaicaTM System reliably detects and quantifies HPV16, HPV18 and the human reference gene ALB within a human DNA sample (Figure 1).},

	Abstract = {Human papillomavirus genomes are classified into molecular variants when they present more than 98% of similarity to the prototype sequence within the L1 gene. Comparative nucleotide sequence analyses of these viruses have elucidated some features of their phylogenetic relationship. In addition, human papillomavirus intratype variability has also been used as an important tool in epidemiological studies of viral transmission, persistence and progression to clinically relevant cervical lesions. Until the present, little has been published concerning the functional significance of molecular variants. It has been shown that nucleotide variability within the long control region leads to differences in the binding affinity of some cellular transcriptional factors and to the enhancement of the expression of E6 and E7 oncogenes. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro studies revealed differences in E6 and E7 biochemical and biological properties among molecular variants. Nevertheless, further correlation with additional functional information is needed to evaluate the significance of genome intratypic variability. These results are also important for the development of vaccines and to determine the extent to which immunization with L1 virus-like particles of one variant could induce antibodies that cross-neutralize other variants.},
